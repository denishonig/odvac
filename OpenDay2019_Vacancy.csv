By automating routine checks and corrections, our tools speed up coding and software development, freeing you to grow, discover, and create. Part of the JetBrains family, Kotlin is a modern multiplatform programming language targeting the JVM and compilable to JavaScript as well as Android, iOS, IoT, and other LLVM-enabled platforms.
